# Tab Organizer AI

A minimal, production-ready Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that uses your own OpenAI API key to deduplicate and group the tabs in your current Chrome window.

## Features

- Securely stores your OpenAI API key and preferred model in `chrome.storage.sync`.
- Smart duplicate detection that keeps the most relevant tab (active/pinned/recent) and closes extras.
- AI-powered grouping that creates or updates Chrome tab groups using concise intent-based names.
- Dry-run preview option to inspect the plan before applying changes.
- Respect for pinned tabs and per-domain safeguards.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open **chrome://extensions** in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing this project.

## Configuration

1. In the extensions list, click **Details** for Tab Organizer AI and open the **Extension options** page.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`) and optionally choose a model (defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`).
3. Adjust preferences:
   - Keep at least one tab per domain.
   - Preserve pinned tabs.
   - Maximum tabs per group.
   - Dry-run preview before applying changes.
4. Click **Save changes**. The key and settings are stored locally via `chrome.storage.sync` and only used to call the OpenAI API.

## Usage

1. Open the popup from the extension toolbar.
2. Provide optional guidance in the multiline field (e.g., "Group by project" or "Prioritize research vs entertainment").
3. Press **Organize**.
   - If dry-run is enabled, review the preview and press **Apply plan** to execute.
   - Otherwise, the service worker will immediately close duplicates, create/update tab groups, and tidy empty ones.
4. Status updates and any errors are shown at the bottom of the popup.

## Permissions rationale

- `storage`: save your API key, model, and organization preferences.
- `tabs`: read metadata (title, URL, pinned, active) and close duplicates in the current window.
- `tabGroups`: create, update, and clean up Chrome tab groups during organization.
- `host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`): required to read tab URLs for deduplication and grouping context; no network requests are made to page content.

## Privacy & network behavior

- The extension uses your API key exclusively to call `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.
- No analytics, telemetry, or third-party network calls.
- All processing happens in the background service workerâ€”no content scripts are injected into web pages.

## Development notes

- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no bundlers).
- Manifest V3 with an ES module service worker.
- Code is organized into small modules: `llm.js` for OpenAI calls, `tab_utils.js` for tab analysis, and UI scripts for popup/options pages.
